# Conclusion

We hope you agree that Rocket is a refreshing take on web frameworks. As with
any software project, Rocket is _alive_. There are always things to improve, and
we're happy to take the best ideas. If you have something in mind, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues).

## Getting Help

If you find yourself having trouble developing Rocket applications, you can get
help via chat at [`#rocket:mozilla.org`] on Matrix or the bridged [`#rocket`]
IRC channel on Libera.Chat at `irc.libera.chat`. We recommend joining us on
[Matrix via Element]. If you prefer IRC, you can join via the [Kiwi IRC client]
or a client of your own. The [FAQ](../faq/) also provides answers to commonly
asked questions.

## What's next?

The best way to learn Rocket is to _build something_. It should be fun and easy,
and there's always someone to help. Alternatively, you can read through the
[Rocket examples](@example) or the [Rocket source code](@github/core/lib/src).
Whatever you decide to do next, we hope you have a blast!
