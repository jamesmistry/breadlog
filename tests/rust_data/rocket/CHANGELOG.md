# Version 0.5.0-rc.3 (Mar 23, 2023)

## Major Features and Improvements

  * Added a [`max_blocking`] configuration parameter.

    The parameter sets a limit on the number of threads used by blocking tasks.

  * Added an [`ip_header`] "real IP" header configuration parameter.

    The parameter allows modifying the header that Rocket attempts to use to retrieve the "real IP"
    address of the client via `Request` methods like [`Request::client_ip()`]. Additionally, the
    change allows disabling the use of any such header entirely.

  * A [`pool()`] method is emitted by [`rocket_sync_db_pools`] for code-generated pools.

    The method returns an opaque reference to a type that can be used to retrieve pooled connections
    outside of a request handling context.

  * Raw binary form field data can be retrieved using the `&[u8]` form guard.

  * Data guards are now eligible [sentinels].

## General Improvements

  * Final launch messages are now _always_ logged, irrespective of profile.
  * Only functions that return `Rocket<Build>` are now `#[must_use]`, not all `Rocket<P>`.
  * Fixed mismatched form field names in errors under certain conditions in [`FromForm`] derive.
  * The [`FromForm`] derive now collects _all_ errors that occur.
  * Data pools are now gracefully shutdown in [`rocket_sync_db_pools`].
  * Added [`Metadata::render()`] in [`rocket_dyn_templates`] for direct template rendering.
  * Rocket salvages more information from malformed requests for error catchers.
  * The `cookie` `secure` feature is now properly conditionally enabled.
  * Data before encapsulation boundaries in TLS keys is allowed and ignored.
  * Support for TLS keys in SEC1 format was added.
  * Rocket now warns when a known secret key is configured.
  * A panic that could occur on shutdown in `rocket_sync_db_pools` was fixed.

# Version 0.5.0-rc.1 (Jun 09, 2021)

## Major Features and Improvements

This release introduces the following major features and improvements:

  * Support for [compilation on Rust's stable] release channel.
  * A rewritten, fully asynchronous core with support for [`async`/`await`].
  * [Feature-complete forms support] including multipart, collections, [ad-hoc validation], and
    [context](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/requests/#context).
  * [Sentinels]: automatic verification of application state at start-up to prevent runtime errors.
  * [Graceful shutdown] with configurable signaling, grace periods, notification via [`Shutdown`].
  * An entirely new, flexible and robust [configuration system] based on [Figment].
  * Typed [asynchronous streams] and [Server-Sent Events] with generator syntax.
  * Automatic support for HTTP/2 including `h2` ALPN.
  * Graduation of `json`, `msgpack`, and `uuid` `rocket_contrib` [features into core].
  * An automatically enabled [`Shield`]: security and privacy headers for all responses.
  * Type-system enforced [incoming data limits] to mitigate memory-based DoS attacks.
  * Compile-time URI literals via a fully revamped [`uri!`] macro.
  * Full support for [UTF-8 characters] in routes and catchers.
  * Precise detection of unmanaged state and missing database, template fairings with [sentinels].
  * Typed [build phases] with strict application-level guarantees.
  * [Ignorable segments]: wildcard route matching with no typing restrictions.
  * First-class [support for `serde`] for built-in guards and types.
  * New application launch attributes:
    [`#[launch]`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/attr.launch.html) and
    [`#[rocket::main]`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/attr.main.html).
  * [Default catchers] via `#[catch(default)]`, which handle _any_ status code.
  * [Catcher scoping] to narrow the scope of a catcher to a URI prefix.
  * Built-in libraries and support for [asynchronous testing].
  * A [`TempFile`] data and form guard for automatic uploading to a temporary file.
  * A [`Capped<T>`] data and form guard which enables detecting truncation due to data limits.
  * Support for dynamic and static prefixing and suffixing of route URIs in [`uri!`].
  * Support for custom config profiles and [automatic typed config extraction].
  * Rewritten, zero-copy, RFC compliant URI parsers with support for URI-[`Reference`]s.
  * Multi-segment parameters (`<param..>`) which match _zero_ segments.
  * A [`request::local_cache!`] macro for request-local storage of non-uniquely typed values.
  * A [`CookieJar`] without "one-at-a-time" limitations.
  * [Singleton fairings] with replacement and guaranteed uniqueness.
  * [Data limit declaration in SI units]: "2 MiB", `2.mebibytes()`.
  * Optimistic responding even when data is left unread or limits are exceeded.
  * Fully decoded borrowed strings as dynamic parameters, form and data guards.
  * Borrowed byte slices as data and form guards.
  * Fail-fast behavior for [misconfigured secrets], file serving paths.
  * Support for generics and custom generic bounds in
    [`#[derive(Responder)]`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/derive.Responder.html).
  * [Default ranking colors], which prevent more routing collisions automatically.
  * Improved error logging with suggestions when common errors are detected.
  * Completely rewritten examples including a new real-time [`chat`] application.

## Support for Rust Stable

As a result of support for Rust stable (Rust 2021 Edition and beyond), the
`#![feature(..)]` crate attribute is no longer required for Rocket applications.
The complete canonical example with a single `hello` route becomes:

```rust
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;

#[get("/<name>/<age>")]
fn hello(name: &str, age: u8) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name)
}

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build().mount("/hello", routes![hello])
}
```

+ }
```

</details>

## Breaking Changes

This release includes many breaking changes. The most significant changes are listed below.

### Silent Changes

These changes are invisible to the compiler and will _not_ yield errors or warnings at compile-time.
We **strongly** advise all application authors to review this list carefully.

  * Blocking I/O (long running compute, synchronous `sleep()`, `Mutex`, `RwLock`, etc.) may prevent
    the server from making progress and should be avoided, replaced with an `async` variant, or
    performed in a worker thread. This is a consequence of Rust's cooperative `async` multitasking.
    For details, see the new [multitasking] section of the guide.
  * `ROCKET_ENV` is now `ROCKET_PROFILE`. A warning is emitted a launch time if the former is set.
  * The default profile for debug builds is now `debug`, not `dev`.
  * The default profile for release builds is now `release`, not `prod`.
  * `ROCKET_LOG` is now `ROCKET_LOG_LEVEL`. A warning is emitted a launch time if the former is set.
  * `ROCKET_ADDRESS` accepts only IP addresses, no longer resolves hostnames like `localhost`.
  * `ROCKET_CLI_COLORS` accepts booleans `true`, `false` in place of strings `"on"`, `"off"`.
  * It is a launch-time error if `secrets` is enabled in non-`debug` profiles without a configured
    `secret_key`.
  * A misconfigured `template_dir` is reported as an error at launch time.
  * [`FileServer::new()`] fails immediately if the provided directory does not exist.
  * Catcher collisions result in a launch failure as opposed to a warning.
  * Default ranks now range from `-12` to `-1`. There is no breaking change if only code generated
    routes are used. Manually configured routes with negative ranks may collide or be considered in
    a different order than before.
  * The order of execution of path and query guards relative to each other is now unspecified.
  * URIs beginning with `:` are properly recognized as invalid and rejected.
  * URI normalization now normalizes the query part as well.
  * The `Segments` iterator now returns percent-decoded `&str`s.
  * Forms are now parsed leniently by the [`Form` guard]. Use [`Strict`] for the previous behavior.
  * The `Option<T>` form guard defaults to `None` instead of the default value for `T`.
  * When data limits are exceeded, a `413 Payload Too Large` status is returned to the client.
  * The default catcher now returns JSON when the client indicates preference via the `Accept`
    header.
  * Empty boolean form values parse as `true`: the query string `?f` is the same as `?f=true`.
  * [`Created<R>`] does not automatically send an `ETag` header if `R: Hash`. Use
    [`Created::tagged_body`] instead.
  * `FileServer` now forwards when a file is not found instead of failing with `404 Not Found`.
  * [`Shield`] is enabled by default. You may need to disable or change policies if your application
    depends on typically insecure browser features or if you wish to opt-in to different policies
    than the defaults.
  * [`CookieJar`] `get()`s do not return cookies added during request handling. See
    [`CookieJar`#pending].

### Contrib Graduation

  * The `rocket_contrib` crate has been deprecated and should no longer be used.
  * Several features previously in `rocket_contrib` were merged into `rocket` itself:
    * `json`, `msgpack`, and `uuid` are now [features of `rocket`].
    * Moved `rocket_contrib::json` to [`rocket::serde::json`].
    * Moved `rocket_contrib::msgpack` to [`rocket::serde::msgpack`].
    * Moved `rocket_contrib::uuid` to [`rocket::serde::uuid`].
    * Moved `rocket_contrib::helmet` to [`rocket::shield`]. [`Shield`] is enabled by default.
    * Moved `rocket_contrib::serve` to [`rocket::fs`], `StaticFiles` to [`rocket::fs::FileServer`].
    * Removed the now unnecessary `Uuid` and `JsonValue` wrapper types.
    * Removed headers in `Shield` that are no longer respected by browsers.
  * The remaining features from `rocket_contrib` are now provided by separate crates:
    * Replaced `rocket_contrib::templates` with [`rocket_dyn_templates`].
    * Replaced `rocket_contrib::databases` with [`rocket_sync_db_pools`] and [`rocket_db_pools`].
    * These crates are versioned and released independently of `rocket`.
    * `rocket_contrib::databases::DbError` is now `rocket_sync_db_pools::Error`.
    * Removed `redis`, `mongodb`, and `mysql` integrations which have upstream `async` drivers.
    * The [`#[database]`](https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket_sync_db_pools/attr.database.html)
      attribute generates an [`async run()`] method instead of `Deref` implementations.

### General

  * [`Rocket`] is now generic over a [phase] marker:
    * APIs operate on `Rocket<Build>`, `Rocket<Ignite>`, `Rocket<Orbit>`, or `Rocket<P: Phase>` as
      needed.
    * The phase marker statically enforces state transitions in `Build`, `Ignite`, `Orbit` order.
    * `rocket::ignite()` is now [`rocket::build()`], returns a `Rocket<Build>`.
    * [`Rocket::ignite()`] transitions to the `Ignite` phase. This is run automatically on launch as
      needed.
    * Ignition finalizes configuration, runs `ignite` fairings, and verifies [sentinels].
    * [`Rocket::launch()`] transitions into the `Orbit` phase and starts the server.
    * Methods like [`Request::rocket()`] that refer to a live Rocket instance return an
      `&Rocket<Orbit>`.
  * [Fairings] have been reorganized and restructured for `async`:
    * Replaced `attach` fairings with `ignite` fairings. Unlike `attach` fairings, which ran
      immediately at the time of attachment, `ignite` fairings are run when transitioning into the
      `Ignite` phase.
    * Replaced `launch` fairings with `liftoff` fairings. `liftoff` fairings are always run, even in
      local clients, after the server begins listening and the concrete port is known.
  * Introduced a new [configuration system] based on [Figment]:
    * The concept of "environments" is replaced with "profiles".
    * `ROCKET_ENV` is superseded by `ROCKET_PROFILE`.
    * `ROCKET_LOG` is superseded by `ROCKET_LOG_LEVEL`.
    * Profile names can now be arbitrarily chosen. The `dev`, `stage`, and `prod` profiles carry no
      special meaning.
    * The `debug` and `release` profiles are the default profiles for the debug and release
      compilation profiles.
    * A new specially recognized `default` profile specifies defaults for all profiles.
    * The `global` profile has highest precedence, followed by the selected profile, followed by
      `default`.
    * Added support for limits specified in SI units: "1 MiB".
    * Renamed `LoggingLevel` to [`LogLevel`].
    * Inlined error variants into the [`Error`] structure.
    * Changed the type of `workers` to `usize` from `u16`.
    * Changed accepted values for `keep_alive`: it is disabled with `0`, not `false` or `off`.
    * Disabled the `secrets` feature (for private cookies) by default.
    * Removed APIs related to "extras". Typed values can be extracted from the configured `Figment`.
    * Removed `ConfigBuilder`: all fields of [`Config`] are public with constructors for each field
      type.
  * Many functions, traits, and trait bounds have been modified for `async`:
    * [`FromRequest`], [`Fairing`], [`catcher::Handler`], [`route::Handler`], and [`FromData`] use
      `#[async_trait]`.
    * [`NamedFile::open`] is now an `async` function.
    * Added [`Request::local_cache_async()`] for use in async request guards.
    * Unsized `Response` bodies must be [`AsyncRead`] instead of `Read`.
    * Automatically sized `Response` bodies must be [`AsyncSeek`] instead of `Seek`.
    * The `local` module is split into two: [`rocket::local::asynchronous`] and
      [`rocket::local::blocking`].
  * Functionality and features requiring Rust nightly were removed:
    * Removed the `Try` implementation on [`Outcome`] which allowed using `?` with `Outcome`s. The
      recommended replacement is the [`rocket::outcome::try_outcome!`] macro or the various
      combinator functions on `Outcome`.
    * [`Result<T, E>` implements `Responder`] only when both `T` and `E` implement `Responder`. The
      new [`Debug`] wrapping responder replaces `Result<T: Responder, E: Debug>`.
    * APIs which used the `!` type to now use [`std::convert::Infallible`].
  * [`Rocket::register()`] now takes a base path to scope catchers under as its first argument.
  * `ErrorKind::Collision` has been renamed to [`ErrorKind::Collisions`].

[phase]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/struct.Rocket.html#phases

### Routing and URIs

  * In `#[route(GET, path = "...")]`, `path` is now `uri`: `#[route(GET, uri = "...")]`.
  * Multi-segment paths (`/<p..>`) now match _zero_ or more segments.
  * Codegen improvements preclude identically named routes and modules in the same namespace.
  * A route URI like (`/<a>/<p..>`) now collides with (`/<a>`), requires a `rank` to resolve.
  * All catcher related types and traits moved to [`rocket::catcher`].
  * All route related types and traits moved to [`rocket::route`].
  * URI formatting types and traits moved to [`rocket::http::uri::fmt`].
  * `T` no longer converts to `Option<T>` or `Result<T, _>` for [`uri!`] query parameters.
  * For optional query parameters, [`uri!`] requires using a wrapped value or `_`.
  * `&RawStr` no longer implements `FromParam`: use `&str` instead.
  * Percent-decoding is performed before calling `FromParam` implementations.
  * `RawStr::url_decode()` and `RawStr::url_decode_lossy()` allocate as necessary, return `Cow`.
  * `RawStr::from_str()` was replaced with `RawStr::new()`.
  * `Origin::segments()` was replaced with `Origin.path().segments()`.
  * `Origin::path()` and `Origin::query()` return `&RawStr` instead of `&str`.
  * The type of `Route::name` is now `Option<Cow<'static, str>>`.
  * `Route::set_uri` was replaced with [`Route::map_base()`].
  * `Route::uri()` returns a new [`RouteUri`] type.
  * `Route::base` was removed in favor of `Route.uri().base()`.

[`RouteUri`]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/rocket/route/struct.RouteUri.html

### Data and Forms

  * `Data` now has a lifetime: `Data<'r>`.
  * [`Data::open()`] indelibly requires a data limit.
  * Removed `FromDataSimple`. Use [`FromData`] and [`local_cache!`] or [`local_cache_once!`].
  * All [`DataStream`] APIs require limits and return [`Capped<T>`] types.
  * Form types and traits were moved from `rocket::request` to [`rocket::form`].
  * Removed `FromQuery`. Dynamic query parameters (`#[get("/?<param>")]`) use [`FromForm`] instead.
  * Replaced `FromFormValue` with [`FromFormField`]. All `T: FromFormField` implement `FromForm`.
  * Form field values are percent-decoded before calling [`FromFormField`] implementations.
  * Renamed the `#[form(field = ...)]` attribute to `#[field(name = ...)]`.

### Request Guards

  * Renamed `Cookies` to [`CookieJar`]. Its methods take `&self`.
  * Renamed `Flash.name` to `Flash.kind`, `Flash.msg` to `Flash.message`.
  * Replaced `Request::get_param()` with `Request::param()`.
  * Replaced `Request::get_segments()` to `Request::segments()`.
  * Replaced `Request::get_query_value()` with `Request::query_value()`.
  * Replaced `Segments::into_path_buf()` with `Segments::to_path_buf()`.
  * Replaced `Segments` and `QuerySegments` with [`Segments<Path>` and `Segments<Query>`].
  * [`Flash`] constructors to take `Into<String>` instead of `AsRef<str>`.
  * The `State<'_, T>` request guard is now `&State<T>`.
  * Removed a lifetime from [`FromRequest`]: `FromRequest<'r>`.
  * Removed a lifetime from [`FlashMessage`]: `FlashMessage<'_>`.
  * Removed all `State` reexports except [`rocket::State`].

### Responders

  * Moved `NamedFile` to `rocket::fs::NamedFile`
  * Replaced `Content` with `content::Custom`.
  * `Response::body` and `Response::body_mut` are now infallible methods.
  * Renamed `ResponseBuilder` to `Builder`.
  * Removed direct `Response` body reading methods. Use methods on `r.body_mut()` instead.
  * Removed inaccurate "chunked body" types and variants.
  * Removed `Responder` `impl` for `Response`. Prefer custom responders with `#[derive(Responder)]`.
  * Removed the unused reason phrase from `Status`.

## General Improvements

In addition to new features and major improvements, Rocket saw the following improvements:

### General

  * Added support for [raw identifiers] in the `FromForm` derive, `#[route]` macros, and `uri!`.
  * Added support for uncased derived form fields: `#[field(name = uncased(...))]`.
  * Added support for [default form field values]: `#[field(default = expr())]`.
  * Added support for multiple `#[field]` attributes on struct fields.
  * Added support for base16-encoded (a.k.a. hex-encoded) secret keys.

  * Added support for [hierarchical data limits]: a limit of `a/b/c` falls back to `a/b` then `a`.
  * Added [`LocalRequest::inner_mut()`]. `LocalRequest` implements `DerefMut` to `Request`.
  * Added support for ECDSA and EdDSA TLS keys.
  * Added associated constants in `Config` for all config parameter names.
  * Added `ErrorKind::Config` to represent errors in configuration at runtime.
  * Added `rocket::fairing::Result` type alias, returned by `Fairing::on_ignite()`.
  * All guard failures are logged at runtime.
  * `Rocket::mount()` now accepts a base value of any type that implements `TryInto<Origin<'_>>`.
  * The default error catcher's HTML has been compacted.
  * The default error catcher returns JSON if requested by the client.
  * Panics in routes or catchers are caught and forwarded to `500` error catcher.
  * A detailed warning is emitted if a route or catcher panics.
  * Emoji characters are no longer output on Windows.
  * Fixed [`Error`] to not panic if a panic is already in progress.
  * Introduced [`Reference`] and [`Asterisk`] URI types.
  * Added support to [`UriDisplayQuery`] for C-like enums.
  * The [`UriDisplayQuery`] derive now recognizes the `#[field]` attribute for field renaming.
  * `Client` method builders accept `TryInto<Origin>` allowing a `uri!()` to be used directly.
  * [`Redirect`] now accepts a `TryFrom<Reference>`, allowing fragment parts.

### HTTP

  * Added AVIF (`image/avif`) as a known media type.
  * Added `EventStream` (`text/event-stream`) as a known media type.
  * Added a `const` constructor for `MediaType`.

# Version 0.4.4 (Mar 09, 2020)

## Core

  * Removed use of unsupported `cfg(debug_assertions)` in `Cargo.toml`, allowing
    for builds on latest nightlies.

## Docs

  * Fixed various broken links.

# Version 0.4.3 (Feb 29, 2020)

## Core

  * Added a new [`Debug`] `500` `Responder` that `Debug`-prints its contents on
    response.
  * Specialization on `Result` was deprecated. [`Debug`] can be used in place of
    non-`Responder` errors.
  * Fixed an issue that resulted in cookies not being set on error responses.
  * Various `Debug` implementations on Rocket types now respect formatting
    options.
  * Added `Responder`s for various HTTP status codes: [`NoContent`],
    [`Unauthorized`], [`Forbidden`], and [`Conflict`].
  * `FromParam` is implemented for `NonZero` core types.

## Codegen

  * Docs for Rocket-generated macros are now hidden.
  * Generated code now works even when prelude imports like `Some`, `Ok`, and
    `Err` are shadowed.
  * Error messages referring to responder types in routes now point to the type
    correctly.

## Docs

  * All code examples in the guide are now tested and guaranteed to compile.
  * All macros are documented in the `core` crate; `rocket_codegen` makes no
    appearances.

## Infrastructure

  * CI was moved from Travis to Azure Pipelines; Windows support is tested.
  * Rocket's chat moved to [Matrix] and [Freenode].

## Codegen Rewrite

The [`rocket_codegen`] crate has been entirely rewritten using to-be-stable
procedural macro APIs. We expect nightly breakages to drop dramatically, likely
to zero, as a result. The new prelude import for Rocket applications is:

```diff
- #![feature(plugin)]
- #![plugin(rocket_codegen)]
+ #![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]

- extern crate rocket;
+ #[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
```

The [`rocket_codegen`] crate should **_not_** be a direct dependency. Remove it
from your `Cargo.toml`:

```diff
[dependencies]
- rocket = "0.3"
+ rocket = "0.4"
- rocket_codegen = "0.3"
```

[`rocket_codegen`]: https://api.rocket.rs/v0.4/rocket_codegen/index.html

## Breaking Changes

This release includes many breaking changes. These changes are listed below
along with a short note about how to handle the breaking change in existing
applications when applicable.

  * **Route and catcher attributes respect function privacy.**

    To mount a route or register a catcher outside of the module it is declared,
    ensure that the handler function is marked `pub` or `crate`.

  * **Query handling syntax has been completely revamped.**

    A query parameter of `<param>` is now `<param..>`. Consider whether your
    application benefits from the revamped [query string handling].

  * **The `#[error]` attribute and `errors!` macro were removed.**

    Use `#[catch]` and `catchers!` instead.

  * **`Rocket::catch()` was renamed to [`Rocket::register()`].**

    Change calls of the form `.catch(errors![..])` to
    `.register(catchers![..])`.

  * **The `#[catch]` attribute only accepts functions with 0 or 1 argument.**

    Ensure the argument to the catcher, if any, is of type `&Request`.

  * **[`json!`] returns a [`JsonValue`], no longer needs wrapping.**

    Change instances of `Json(json!(..))` to `json!` and change the
    corresponding type to `JsonValue`.

  * **All environments default to port 8000.**

    Manually configure a port of `80` for the `stage` and `production`
    environments for the previous behavior.

  * **Release builds default to the production environment.**

    Manually set the environment to `debug` with `ROCKET_ENV=debug` for the
    previous behavior.

  * **[`Form`] and [`LenientForm`] lost a lifetime parameter, `get()` method.**

    Change a type of `Form<'a, T<'a>>` to `Form<T>` or `Form<T<'a>>`. `Form<T>`
    and `LenientForm<T>` now implement `Deref<Target = T>`, allowing for calls
    to `.get()` to be removed.

  * **[`ring`] was updated to 0.13.**

    Ensure all transitive dependencies to `ring` refer to version `0.13`.

  * **`Uri` was largely replaced by [`Origin`].**

    In general, replace the type `Uri` with `Origin`. The `base` and `uri`
    fields of [`Route`] are now of type [`Origin`]. The `&Uri` guard is now
    `&Origin`. [`Request::uri()`] now returns an [`Origin`].

  * **All items in [`rocket_contrib`] are namespaced behind modules.**

    * `Json` is now `json::Json`
    * `MsgPack` is now `msgpack::MsgPack`
    * `MsgPackError` is now `msgpack::Error`
    * `Template` is now `templates::Template`
    * `UUID` is now `uuid::Uuid`
    * `Value` is replaced by `json::JsonValue`

  * **TLS certificates require the `subjectAltName` extension.**

    Ensure that your TLS certificates contain the `subjectAltName` extension
    with a value set to your domain.

  * **Route paths, mount points, and [`LocalRequest`] URIs are strictly
    checked.**

    Ensure your mount points are absolute paths with no parameters, ensure your
    route paths are absolute paths with proper parameter syntax, and ensure that
    paths passed to `LocalRequest` are valid.

  * **[`Template::show()`] takes an `&Rocket`, doesn't accept a `root`.**

    Use [`client.rocket()`] to get a reference to an instance of `Rocket` when
    testing. Use [`Template::render()`] in routes.

  * **[`Request::remote()`] returns the _actual_ remote IP, doesn't rewrite.**

    Use [`Request::real_ip()`] or [`Request::client_ip()`] to retrieve the IP
    address from the "X-Real-IP" header if it is present.

  * **[`Bind`] variant was added to [`LaunchErrorKind`].**

    Ensure matches on `LaunchErrorKind` include or ignore the `Bind` variant.

  * **Cookies are automatically tracked and propagated by [`Client`].**

    For the previous behavior, construct a `Client` with
    [`Client::untracked()`].

  * **`UUID` was renamed to [`Uuid`].**

    Use `Uuid` instead of `UUID`.

  * **`LocalRequest::cloned_dispatch()` was removed.**

    Chain calls to `.clone().dispatch()` for the previous behavior.

  * **[`Redirect`] constructors take a generic type of `T:
    TryInto<Uri<'static>>`.**

    A call to a `Redirect` constructor with a non-`'static` `&str`  of the form
    `Redirect::to(string)` should become `Redirect::to(string.to_string())`,
    heap-allocating the string before being passed to the constructor.

  * **The [`FromData`] impl for [`Form`] and [`LenientForm`] now return an error
    of type [`FormDataError`].**

    On non-I/O errors, the form string is stored in the variant as an `&'f str`.

  * **[`Missing`] variant was added to [`ConfigError`].**

    Ensure matches on `ConfigError` include or ignore the `Missing` variant.

  * **The [`FromData`] impl for [`Json`] now returns an error of type
    [`JsonError`].**

    The previous `SerdeError` is now the `.1` member of the `JsonError` `enum`.
    Match and destruct the variant for the previous behavior.

  * **[`FromData`] is now emulated by [`FromDataSimple`].**

    Change _implementations_, not uses, of `FromData` to `FromDataSimple`.
    Consider whether your implementation could benefit from [transformations].

  * **[`FormItems`] iterates over values of type [`FormItem`].**

    Map using `.map(|item| item.key_value())` for the previous behavior.

  * **[`LaunchErrorKind::Collision`] contains a vector of the colliding routes.**

    Destruct using `LaunchErrorKind::Collision(..)` to ignore the vector.

  * **[`Request::get_param()`] and [`Request::get_segments()`] are indexed by
    _segment_, not dynamic parameter.**

    Modify the `n` argument in calls to these functions appropriately.

  * **Method-based route attributes no longer accept a keyed `path` parameter.**

    Change an attribute of the form `#[get(path = "..")]` to `#[get("..")]`.

  * **[`Json`] and [`MsgPack`] data guards no longer reject requests with an
    unexpected Content-Type**

    To approximate the previous behavior, add a `format = "json"` route
    parameter when using `Json` or `format = "msgpack"` when using `MsgPack`.

  * **Implemented [`Responder` for `Status`]. Removed `Failure`,
    `status::NoContent`, and `status::Reset` responders.**

    Replace uses of `Failure(status)` with `status` directly. Replace
    `status::NoContent` with `Status::NoContent`. Replace `status::Reset` with
    `Status::ResetContent`.

  * **[`Config::root()`] returns an `Option<&Path>` instead of an `&Path`.**

    For the previous behavior, use `config.root().unwrap()`.

  * **[`Status::new()`] is no longer `const`.**

    Construct a `Status` directly.

  * **[`Config`] constructors return a `Config` instead of a `Result<Config>`.**

  * **`ConfigError::BadCWD`, `Config.config_path` were removed.**

  * **[`Json`] no longer has a default value for its type parameter.**

  * **Using `data` on a non-payload method route is a warning instead of error.**

  * **The `raw_form_string` method of [`Form`] and [`LenientForm`] was
    removed.**

  * **Various impossible `Error` associated types are now set to `!`.**

  * **All [`AdHoc`] constructors require a name as the first parameter.**

  * **The top-level `Error` type was removed.**

## Breaking Changes

This release includes many breaking changes. These changes are listed below
along with a short note about how to handle the breaking change in existing
applications.

  * **`session_key` was renamed to `secret_key`, requires a 256-bit base64 key**

    It's unlikely that `session_key` was previously used. If it was, rename
    `session_key` to `secret_key`. Generate a random 256-bit base64 key using a
    tool like openssl: `openssl rand -base64 32`.

  * **The `&Cookies` request guard has been removed in favor of `Cookies`**

    Change `&Cookies` in a request guard position to `Cookies`.

  * **`Rocket::launch()` now returns a `LaunchError`, doesn't panic.**

    For the old behavior, suffix a call to `.launch()` with a semicolon:
    `.launch();`.

  * **Routes without query parameters match requests with or without query
    parameters.**

    There is no workaround, but this change may allow manual ranks from routes
    to be removed.

  * **The `format` route attribute on non-payload requests matches against the
    Accept header.**

    Excepting a custom request guard, there is no workaround. Previously,
    `format` always matched against the Content-Type header, regardless of
    whether the request method indicated a payload or not.

  * **A type of `&str` can no longer be used in form structures or parameters.**

    Use the new [`&RawStr`] type instead.

  * **`ContentType` is no longer a request guard.**

    Use `&ContentType` instead.

  * **`Request::content_type()` returns `&ContentType` instead of
    `ContentType`.**

    Use `.clone()` on `&ContentType` if a type of `ContentType` is required.

  * **`Response::header_values()` was removed. `Response::headers()` now returns
    an `&HeaderMap`.**

    A call to `Response::headers()` can be replaced with
    `Response::headers().iter()`. A call to `Response::header_values(name)` can
    be replaced with `Response::headers().get(name)`.

  * **Route collisions result in a hard error and panic.**

    There is no workaround. Previously, route collisions were a warning.

  * **The [`IntoOutcome`] trait has been expanded and made more flexible.**

    There is no workaround. `IntoOutcome::into_outcome()` now takes a `Failure`
    value to use. `IntoOutcome::or_forward()` was added to return a `Forward`
    outcome if `self` indicates an error.

  * **The 'testing' feature was removed.**

    Remove `features = ["testing"]` from `Cargo.toml`. Use the new [`local`]
    module for testing.

  * **`serde` was updated to 1.0.**

    There is no workaround. Ensure all dependencies rely on `serde` `1.0`.

  * **`config::active()` was removed.**

    Use [`Rocket::config()`] to retrieve the configuration before launch. If
    needed, use [managed state] to store config information for later use.

  * **The [`Responder`] trait has changed.**

    `Responder::respond(self)` was removed in favor of
    `Responder::respond_to(self, &Request)`. Responders may dynamically adjust
    their response based on the incoming request.

  * **`Outcome::of(Responder)` was removed while `Outcome::from(&Request,
    Responder)` was added.**

    Use `Outcome::from(..)` instead of `Outcome::of(..)`.

  * **Usage of templates requires `Template::fairing()` to be attached.**

    Call `.attach(Template::fairing())` on the application's Rocket instance
    before launching.

  * **The `Display` implementation of `Template` was removed.**

    Use [`Template::show()`] to render a template directly.

  * **`Request::new()` is no longer exported.**

    There is no workaround.

  * **The [`FromForm`] trait has changed.**

    `Responder::from_form_items(&mut FormItems)` was removed in favor of
    `Responder::from_form(&mut FormItems, bool)`. The second parameter indicates
    whether parsing should be strict (if `true`) or lenient (if `false`).

  * **`LoggingLevel` was removed as a root reexport.**

    It can now be imported from `rocket::config::LoggingLevel`.

  * **An `Io` variant was added to [`ConfigError`].**

    Ensure `match`es on `ConfigError` include an `Io` variant.

  * **[`ContentType::from_extension()`] returns an `Option<ContentType>`.**

    For the old behavior, use `.unwrap_or(ContentType::Any)`.

  * **The `IntoValue` config trait was removed in favor of `Into<Value>`.**

    There is no workaround. Use `Into<Value>` as necessary.

  * **The `rocket_contrib::JSON` type has been renamed to
    [`rocket_contrib::Json`].**

    Use `Json` instead of `JSON`.

  * **All structs in the [`content`] module use TitleCase names.**

    Use `Json`, `Xml`, `Html`, and `Css` instead of `JSON`, `XML`, `HTML`, and
    `CSS`, respectively.

## New Features

This release includes the following new features:

  * Introduced managed state.
  * Added lints that warn on unmanaged state and unmounted routes.
  * Added the ability to set configuration parameters via environment variables.
  * `Config` structures can be built via `ConfigBuilder`, which follows the
    builder pattern.
  * Logging can be enabled or disabled on custom configuration via a second
    parameter to the `Rocket::custom` method.
  * `name` and `value` methods were added to `Header` to retrieve the name and
    value of a header.
  * A new configuration parameter, `workers`, can be used to set the number of
    threads Rocket uses.
  * The address of the remote connection is available via `Request.remote()`.
    Request preprocessing overrides remote IP with value from the `X-Real-IP`
    header, if present.
  * During testing, the remote address can be set via `MockRequest.remote()`.
  * The `SocketAddr` request guard retrieves the remote address.
  * A `UUID` type has been added to `contrib`.
  * `rocket` and `rocket_codegen` will refuse to build with an incompatible
    nightly version and emit nice error messages.
  * Major performance and usability improvements were upstreamed to the `cookie`
    crate, including the addition of a `CookieBuilder`.
  * When a checkbox isn't present in a form, `bool` types in a `FromForm`
    structure will parse as `false`.
  * The `FormItems` iterator can be queried for a complete parse via `completed`
    and `exhausted`.
  * Routes for `OPTIONS` requests can be declared via the `options` decorator.
  * Strings can be percent-encoded via `URI::percent_encode()`.

## Breaking Changes

This release includes several breaking changes. These changes are listed below
along with a short note about how to handle the breaking change in existing
applications.

  * **`Rocket::custom` takes two parameters, the first being `Config` by
    value.**

    A call in v0.1 of the form `Rocket::custom(&config)` is now
    `Rocket::custom(config, false)`.

  * **Tera templates are named without their extension.**

    A templated named `name.html.tera` is now simply `name`.

  * **`JSON` `unwrap` method has been renamed to `into_inner`.**

    A call to `.unwrap()` should be changed to `.into_inner()`.

  * **The `map!` macro was removed in favor of the `json!` macro.**

    A call of the form `map!{ "a" => b }` can be written as: `json!({ "a": b
    })`.

  * **The `hyper::SetCookie` header is no longer exported.**

    Use the `Cookie` type as an `Into<Header>` type directly.

  * **The `Content-Type` for `String` is now `text/plain`.**

    Use `content::HTML<String>` for HTML-based `String` responses.

  * **`Request.content_type()` returns an `Option<ContentType>`.**

    Use `.unwrap_or(ContentType::Any)` to get the old behavior.

  * **The `ContentType` request guard forwards when the request has no
    `Content-Type` header.**

    Use an `Option<ContentType>` and `.unwrap_or(ContentType::Any)` for the old
    behavior.

  * **A `Rocket` instance must be declared _before_ a `MockRequest`.**

    Change the order of the `rocket::ignite()` and `MockRequest::new()` calls.

  * **A route with `format` specified only matches requests with the same
    format.**

    Previously, a route with a `format` would match requests without a format
    specified. There is no workaround to this change; simply specify formats
    when required.

  * **`FormItems` can no longer be constructed directly.**

    Instead of constructing as `FormItems(string)`, construct as
    `FormItems::from(string)`.

  * **`from_from_string(&str)` in `FromForm` removed in favor of
    `from_form_items(&mut FormItems)`.**

    Most implementation should be using `FormItems` internally; simply use the
    passed in `FormItems`. In other cases, the form string can be retrieved via
    the `inner_str` method of `FormItems`.

  * **`Config::{set, default_for}` are deprecated.**

    Use the `set_{param}` methods instead of `set`, and `new` or `build` in
    place of `default_for`.

  * **Route paths must be absolute.**

    Prepend a `/` to convert a relative path into an absolute one.

  * **Route paths cannot contain empty segments.**

    Remove any empty segments, including trailing ones, from a route path.

## Bug Fixes

A couple of bugs were fixed in this release:

  * Handlebars partials were not properly registered
    ([#122](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket/issues/122)).
  * `Rocket::custom` did not set the custom configuration as the `active`
    configuration.
  * Route path segments containing more than one dynamic parameter were
    allowed.

## General Improvements

In addition to new features, Rocket saw the following smaller improvements:

  * Rocket no longer overwrites a catcher's response status.
  * The `port` `Config` type is now a proper `u16`.
  * Clippy issues injected by codegen are resolved.
  * Handlebars was updated to `0.25`.
  * The `PartialEq` implementation of `Config` doesn't consider the path or
    secret key.
  * Hyper dependency updated to `0.10`.
  * The `Error` type for `JSON as FromData` has been exposed as `SerdeError`.
  * SVG was added as a known Content-Type.
  * Serde was updated to `0.9`.
  * Form parse failure now results in a **422** error code.
  * Tera has been updated to `0.7`.
  * `pub(crate)` is used throughout to enforce visibility rules.
  * Query parameters in routes (`/path?<param>`) are now logged.
  * Routes with and without query parameters no longer _collide_.

## Infrastructure

  * Testing was parallelized, resulting in 3x faster Travis builds.

# Version 0.1.6 (Jan 26, 2017)

# Version 0.1.1 (Dec 23, 2016)

## Core

  * `NamedFile` `Responder` lost its body in the shuffle; it's back!

# Version 0.1.0 (Dec 23, 2016)

This is the first public release of Rocket!

## Breaking

All of the mentions to `hyper` types in core Rocket types are no more. Rocket
now implements its own `Request` and `Response` types.

  * `ContentType` uses associated constants instead of static methods.
  * `StatusCode` removed in favor of new `Status` type.
  * `Response` type alias superseded by `Response` type.
  * `Responder::respond` no longer takes in hyper type.
  * `Responder::respond` returns `Response`, takes `self` by move.
  * `Handler` returns `Outcome` instead of `Response` type alias.
  * `ErrorHandler` returns `Result`.
  * All `Hyper*` types were moved to unprefixed versions in `hyper::`.
  * `MockRequest::dispatch` now returns a `Response` type.
  * `URIBuf` removed in favor of unified `URI`.
  * Rocket panics when an illegal, dynamic mount point is used.

## Core

  * Rocket handles `HEAD` requests automatically.
  * New `Response` and `ResponseBuilder` types.
  * New `Request`, `Header`, `Status`, and `ContentType` types.

## Testing

  * `MockRequest` allows any type of header.
  * `MockRequest` allows cookies.

## Codegen

  * Debug output disabled by default.
  * The `ROCKET_CODEGEN_DEBUG` environment variables enables codegen logging.

# Version 0.0.11 (Dec 11, 2016)

## Streaming Requests

All incoming request data is now streamed. This resulted in a major change to
the Rocket APIs. They are summarized through the following API changes:

  * The `form` route parameter has been removed.
  * The `data` route parameter has been introduced.
  * Forms are now handled via the `data` parameter and `Form` type.
  * Removed the `data` parameter from `Request`.
  * Added `FromData` conversion trait and default implementation.
  * `FromData` is used to automatically derive the `data` parameter.
  * `Responder`s are now final: they cannot forward to other requests.
  * `Responder`s may only forward to catchers.

## Breaking

  * Request `uri` parameter is private. Use `uri()` method instead.
  * `form` module moved under `request` module.
  * `response::data` was renamed to `response::content`.
  * Introduced `Outcome` with `Success`, `Failure`, and `Forward` variants.
  * `outcome` module moved to top-level.
  * `Response` is now a type alias to `Outcome`.
  * `Empty` `Responder` was removed.
  * `StatusResponder` removed in favor of `response::status` module.

## Codegen

  * Error handlers can now take 0, 1, or 2 parameters.
  * `FromForm` derive now works on empty structs.
  * Lifetimes are now properly stripped in code generation.
  * Any valid ident is now allowed in single-parameter route parameters.

## Core

  * Route is now cloneable.
  * `Request` no longer has any lifetime parameters.
  * `Handler` type now includes a `Data` parameter.
  * `http` module is public.
  * `Responder` implemented for `()` type as an empty response.
  * Add `config::get()` for global config access.
  * Introduced `testing` module.
  * `Rocket.toml` allows global configuration via `[global]` table.

## Docs

  * Added a `raw_upload` example.
  * Added a `pastebin` example.
  * Documented all public APIs.

## Testing

  * Now building and running tests with `--all-features` flag.
  * Added appveyor config for Windows CI testing.

# Version 0.0.10 (Oct 03, 2016)

## Breaking

  * Remove `Rocket::new` in favor of `ignite` method.
  * Remove `Rocket::mount_and_launch` in favor of chaining `mount(..).launch()`.
  * `mount` and `catch` take `Rocket` type by value.
  * All types related to HTTP have been moved into `http` module.
  * `Template::render` in `contrib` now takes context by reference.

## Core

  * Rocket now parses option `Rocket.toml` for configuration, defaulting to sane
    values.
  * `ROCKET_ENV` environment variable can be used to specify running environment.

## Docs

  * Document `ContentType`.
  * Document `Request`.
  * Add script that builds docs.

## Testing

  * Scripts can now be run from any directory.
  * Cache Cargo directories in Travis for faster testing.
  * Check that library version numbers match in testing script.

# Version 0.0.9 (Sep 29, 2016)

## Breaking

  * Rename `response::data_type` to `response::data`.

## Core

  * Rocket interprets `_method` field in forms as the incoming request's method.
  * Add `Outcome::Bad` to signify responses that failed internally.
  * Add a `NamedFile` `Responder` type that uses a file's extension for the
    response's content type.
  * Add a `Stream` `Responder` for streaming responses.

## Contrib

  * Introduce the `contrib` crate.
  * Add JSON support via `JSON`, which implements `FromRequest` and `Responder`.
  * Add templating support via `Template` which implements `Responder`.

## Docs

  * Initial guide-like documentation.
  * Add documentation, testing, and contributing sections to README.

## Testing

  * Add a significant number of codegen tests.
