# Contributing to Breadlog
Contributions are welcome, whether they are:

- Bug reports
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Development with GitHub
GitHub is used to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Contributing Changes
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Pull requests are actively encouraged:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Write your code and add tests.
3. Update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Create your pull request!

## Contribution Licensing
By contributing changes you agree for these changes to be licensed under the same [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Reporting Bugs
Report bugs by creating a new issue using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/jamesmistry/breadlog/issues).

Write bug reports with as much detail and background context as possible. Try to use the following bug report format:

- Environment (OS/distro, compiler version if applicable)
- Expected behaviour
- Actual behaviour (including any error messages/logs)
- Steps to reproduce the issue

Thorough bug reports are *great*. They make it easier to reproduce and fix bugs, and therefore make it more likely the bug affecting you will be fixed quickly.

## Code Style
Code style is enforced by rustfmt and described by the `rustfmt.toml` file in the repository root. Most of it is uncontentious, but you may be perturbed by `brace_style = "AlwaysNextLine"`. Hope it doesn't put you off!
